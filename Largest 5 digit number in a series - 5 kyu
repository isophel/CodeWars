def solution(digits):
	
    # iterate over digits and for each 5 number digit check if its larger than max
    # if so new max is equal to currently checked number
    
    max = 0
    for number in range(len(digits)-4):
		temp = int(digits[number:number+5])
		if temp > max:
			max = temp
            
    return max

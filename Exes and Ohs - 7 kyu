Check to see if a string has the same amount of 'x's and 'o's. The method must return a boolean and be case insensitive. The string can contains any char. When no 'x' and 'o' is present should return true.

    # for each element in string
    # check if converted to lowercase string is equal to 'x' or 'o'
    # and add +1 to corresponding variable
    # if no 'x' or 'o' occurse variables are equal to 0

        if str(el).lower() == 'x':
            x += 1
        elif str(el).lower() == 'o':
            o += 1
    if x == o:

    else:
        return False

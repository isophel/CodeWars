Here we have a function that help us spam our hearty laughter. But is not working! I need you to find out why...

Expected results:
```
spam(1);#hue
spam(6);#huehuehuehuehuehue
spam(14);#huehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehue
```
```python
#fix this code!
def spam(number):
    #return ['hue' for i in range(number+1)]
    return 'hue' * number
```
